## Payment Processing

## Billing Disputes
If you notice a billing error or have questions about a charge:
1. Review your billing history in your account dashboard
2. Compare the charge with your current subscription plan
3. Contact our support team if you believe there is an error
4. Disputes must be raised within 60 days of the charge

## Common Billing Questions

### Why was I charged twice?
Duplicate charges may occur due to:
- Processing delays that make a charge appear pending, leading to a retry
- Subscription renewal coinciding with a plan change
- Multiple active subscriptions under the same account

If you see duplicate charges, please contact support immediately for resolution.

### When will I see the charge on my statement?
- Credit card charges typically appear within 1-3 business days
- The charge will show as "YourSaaSCompany" or our payment processor name
- Pending charges may take up to 5 business days to fully process

### How do I update my payment method?
1. Log into your account dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Billing
3. Click "Update Payment Method"
4. Enter new payment details
5. Save changes

The new payment method will be used for the next billing cycle.

### What happens if my payment fails?
1. You receive an immediate email notification
2. We retry the payment automatically after 3 days
3. Another retry occurs after 7 days
4. If all retries fail, your account is suspended after 15 days
5. You can manually retry payment in your dashboard at any time
